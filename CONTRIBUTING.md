[Help with translating](#translating) the website into other languages.

## Setting up the development environment

You'll need to:

1. Install [PostgreSQL][postgres-download] and start it
1. Create [a Battle.net OAuth client][oauth-client] - set the callback URL to `http://localhost:4000/auth/callback`
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the `BATTLE_NET_CLIENT_ID` and `BATTLE_NET_CLIENT_SECRET` values to the ones obtained from the application in the previous step
1. Run `script/setup`

[postgres-download]: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

## Common Tasks

This project follows the [GitHub "scripts to rule them all" pattern](http://githubengineering.com/scripts-to-rule-them-all/). The contents of the `scripts` directory are scripts that cover all common tasks:

* `script/setup` &mdash; Performs first-time setup
* `script/update` &mdash; Performs periodic updating
* `script/test` &mdash; Runs automated tests, format and linter checks
* `script/server` &mdash; Launches the local development web server
* `script/console` &mdash; Opens the development console
* `script/db-console` &mdash; Opens the database console for the development database
* `script/docs` &mdash; Generates developer documentation
* `script/translate` &mdash; Extract and merge new message strings in `priv/gettext`

See the documentation at the top of each script for more information about what each one does and is capable of.

Other scripts that are available but not intended to be used directly by developers:

* `script/bootstrap` &mdash; Used to do a one-time install of all prerequisites for a development machine
* `script/cibuild` &mdash; Used to run automated tests in the CI environment

## Translations

If you would like to help with translating Atom Tweaks into languages other than US English, you can:

1. Create a new directory under `priv/gettext` that is the [name of the locale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software)) for which you will be providing a translation (for example, to provide a translation for Brazilian Portuguese, it would be `priv/gettext/pt_BR`)
1. Run the `script/translate` script to extract and merge the latest version of the strings
1. Add your translations to the `.po` files under your new directory
1. Submit a PR with your changes
